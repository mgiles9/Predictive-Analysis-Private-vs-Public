# Predictive Analysis on Private and Public Universities

## Overview
This project is a predictive data analysis focused on classifying universities as either *Private* or *Public* institutions. The classification is based on key university attributes using a cleaned dataset and machine learning models.

## Objective
The goal is to analyze university data, identify the most significant features that differentiate private and public universities, and develop a predictive model capable of classifying them accurately.

## Dataset
- 777 universities
- 17 features (columns)
- Target variable: `Private` or `Public`

## Selected Features
The five most impactful features selected for analysis:
- Top 10% Students
- Room and Board Cost
- Personal Spending
- Out-of-State Tuition
- Graduation Rate

## Methodology
1. Data Cleaning & Preparation
2. Feature Selection
3. Model Selection & Training
4. Evaluation of Model Accuracy
5. Feature Importance Analysis

## Tools & Technologies
- Python
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib / Seaborn (for visualization)
- Jupyter Notebook

## Results
- The final model achieved accurate classification performance.
- The analysis provided insight into which features were most influential in determining whether a university was private or public.

## Usage
Clone the repository and run:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
jupyter notebook
```

Open `final_project.ipynb` to view the code, analysis, and results.
