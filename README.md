# Predictive-Analysis-Private-vs-Public
Predictive Analysis on Private and Public Universities
Overview
This project is a predictive data analysis focused on classifying universities as either Private or Public institutions. The classification is based on key university attributes using a cleaned dataset and machine learning models.

Objective
The goal is to analyze university data, identify the most significant features that differentiate private and public universities, and develop a predictive model capable of classifying them accurately.

Dataset
777 universities

17 features (columns)

Target variable: Private or Public

Selected Features
The five most impactful features selected for analysis:

Top 10% Students

Room and Board Cost

Personal Spending

Out-of-State Tuition

Graduation Rate

Methodology
Data Cleaning & Preparation

Feature Selection

Model Selection & Training

Evaluation of Model Accuracy

Feature Importance Analysis

Tools & Technologies
Python

Pandas

Scikit-learn

Matplotlib / Seaborn (for visualization)

Jupyter Notebook

Results
The final model achieved accurate classification performance.

The analysis provided insight into which features were most influential in determining whether a university was private or public.
